# Ember Toolchain Evaluation

Emberâ€™s tooling story is getting better every day. This repo is a place to
evaluate the current options, with notes on their relative merits. Each
build tool will get its own branch and notes in the README.

Some factors for consideration:

- **Documentation**  
  How good is the documentation and community support?
- **Maintainers**  
  How approachable are the authors and maintainers?
- **Setup**  
  How many steps from zero to a running test suite?
- **Preview**  
  How easy is it to boot a preview server?
- **Testing**  
  How easy is it to run the test suite (with and without a runner)?
- **Build**  
  How easy is it to build deployable versions of the app?  
  Does it handle switching between debug/production versions of Ember?
- **Deploy**  
  Is there a deploy story and should there be one?
- **Noise**  
  How noisy is the project directory with this tool?
- **Configurability**  
  How easy is it to add/remove dependencies and change the layout?
- **Coupling**  
  How easy would it be to switch over to a different tool/framework?
- **Outlook**  
  How does the future look for this tool?
